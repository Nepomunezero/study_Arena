# Course Explorer — Assignment

This project fetches course data from Coursera public API and presents it in a web app. It demonstrates use of an external API, a backend proxy to avoid CORS, a searchable/filterable frontend, and instructions to deploy on two web servers with a load balancer.

Some Errors I met along the way:

I tried the API and I got an errror becuase there was an error.
once again I made a mistake
